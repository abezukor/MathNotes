# MathNotes
I do not like taking handwritten notes, but I cant find a good notes app that typesets math fast enouph. The best typesetting I know uses [MathQuill](http://mathquill.com/), so this app relies on that for math typesetting. Text notes are taken using markdown.
## Building
This app is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). To get up and running run the following in the root foler.
```bash
npm run dev
```
